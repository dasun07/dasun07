* 👋 Hi, I’m [Dasun Premathilaka](https://github.com/dasun07), a 2nd-year BME PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Prof. Michael I. Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ui8pnoIAAAAJ&hl=en). 
* :star: I am currently working on diffeomorphic frameworks for mapping multimodal data (omics, MRI) onto brain atlases, using image varifold–based representations. It is an extension of the work done by [Dr. Kaitlin Stouffer](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kaitlin-M-Stouffer-2179747140).
* :microscope: My recent research interests include;  

  * Image Varifold-based Representations
  * Diffeomorphic Mappings
  * Computational Anatomy
  * AI for Biomedical Engineering
  
* :watch: Recently, I've been intrigued by the applications of the LDDMM framework and its applications.
* :e-mail: You can reach me via dasunpremethilake@gmail.com or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dasun07/)
